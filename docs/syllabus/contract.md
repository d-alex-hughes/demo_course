# Our Covenant

This section define the covenant that we the instructors, and you the students are entering. You're here to learn and do great work; we're here to guide, mentor, teach and inspire you toward that great work. We've got an idea about what is useful to help you along the way, and we want to communicate that to you here.

## Things that you should do

You should work hard! We have built the resources in this course to be challenging, and challenging in a way that we think will make you the best data scientist you can be, or at least putting you down the path toward achieving this aim. We have set deadlines that are challenging (but achievable), work that is difficult (but surmountable), and lessons that are require effort (but are useful). Work hard at these to get them done.

You should work with your peers. Our community of scholars, researchers, instructors and students is *incredible*. Every one is here for a common purpose, to make themselves the best they can be while working to collectively make this society the best it can be. Work with these people; you will undoubetly learn more from your peers than from any instructor. We wouldn't have it any othe way. 

## Things that you should not do

You should not be isolated in your studies. The circulation of thought is important; developing friendships with your peers is crucial.

You should not shortchange yourself. You're here for a reason; don't take shortcuts that cut short what you could achieve. This means, don't cheat, don't plagarise, don't skip assignments.
