# Course Information

## Course Description 

The goal of this course is to provide students with a foundational
understanding of classical statistics and how it fits within the
broader context of data science. Students will learn to apply the most
common statistical procedures correctly, checking assumptions and
responding appropriately when they appear violated. Emphasis is placed
on different practices that constitute an effective analysis,
including formulating research questions, operationalizing variables,
exploring data, selecting hypothesis tests, and communicating results.

The course begins with an introduction to probability theory, with
pencil-and-paper problem sets to develop intuition for the key
concepts that underlie statistical models. Next, we use the simple
example of the mean to demonstrate the use of estimators and
hypothesis tests. We then turn to classical linear regression, taking
several weeks to build a strong understanding of this central
topic. Our treatment stresses causal inference and includes a
discussion of omitted variables. At the end, we describe some of the
concerns that arise in the process of specifying linear
models. Throughout the course, students will practice analyzing
real-world data using the open-source language, R. (3 units)

## Prerequisites

There are no formal requirements for enrolling in this course. However
because the course deals with optimization, regression, and
probability it would be helpful to have a working understanding of:

- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability

If you would like to review these concepts before the course begins,
see these resources.

## Course Website

- **ISVC** The I School Virtual Campus houses all of our lectures,
meeting links for live session, and homework distribution.

- **GitHub** Course documents will be distributed to
you via GitHub. This includes live session documents,
homeworks, labs, datasets, and really anything else. It is your
responsibility to clone, manage, and keep up to date the repos that
you are given access to. We recommend that as soon as you are given
access to a repo you clone that repo onto your machine and then
immediately start a working branch of that repo so that any updates
that we may later push will not cause any merge conflicts.
